If you try to use the most current version of the GatsbyJS framework, you may encounter a number of bugs if you recreate the hello-world starter site for each section in the tutorial.  Gatsby V2 has some breaking changes and is still undergoing bug fixes and updates; check their repo  https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby.git  to see how recently changes have been made.  If you do have a working starter-site, please continue to adapt it rather than create a new, potentially unusable new site.  And, in the sections covering styling, particularly those involving the typography and CSS-in-HTML packages, please don't try to install them.  Switch the CSS back to using the global.css file. Also, the information for the Weather Plug-ins is misleading; review the configuration file and others below, placement is as shown in my repo https://github.com/jdebettencourt/gatsby-hello-tutorial.git , look in the gatsby-config.js below for an example of the package names; npm install these packages (or clone my repo https://github.com/jdebettencourt/gatsby-hello-tutorial.git  and npm install that; or upload the files, and add those other packages; your choice). Look over the files below for more info. I've also included an OpenWeather query that works; substitute it for the DarkSky query in the newlayout.jsx component.
